Discord Wallet Verification Bot is an automated solution that verifies cryptocurrency wallets on Discord servers and assigns roles based on wallet ownership. It is designed for Web3 communities, NFT projects, DAOs, and blockchain-based platforms that require secure and scalable wallet verification.
This bot allows users to connect their crypto wallets (such as Ethereum and other supported blockchains) to Discord and prove ownership through secure signature-based verification. Once verified, the bot automatically grants Discord roles according to predefined rules, such as NFT ownership, token balance, or whitelist status.
